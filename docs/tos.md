# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** Whenever you read this

## 1. Introduction
Hey there! This is the Terms of Service for using this thing I made. It's not super official, but it exists because someone said I need one to use their APIs. So, here we go.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms
By using this, you're kind of agreeing to these terms. If you're not cool with that, maybe don't use it?

## 3. Changes to These Terms
I might change this TOS if I need to. If I do, I’ll update it here. Keep using the service? That means you're okay with the changes.

## 4. Using the Service
Please don't do anything shady or illegal with this. Just use it like a normal person, okay?

## 5. User Accounts
If you make an account, try not to lose your password. If you do, I can’t really help much. You’re on your own with that one.

## 6. Intellectual Property
I made this, so technically, the stuff here belongs to me. Just don't steal it or pretend you made it.

## 7. Termination
If you do something weird or bad, I might have to kick you out. Let’s keep things chill so that doesn’t happen.

## 8. Limitation of Liability
If something goes wrong while you're using this, I’m probably not responsible. It’s just how it is.

## 9. Governing Law
This is based on the laws where I live. If you live somewhere else, your laws might apply too. But let’s hope it doesn’t get that complicated.

## 10. Contact Information
Questions? Just reach out to me at tos@benbowles.me. I’ll try to get back to you.
