# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** Whenever you read this

## 1. Introduction
Hey there! This is the Privacy Policy for using this thing I made. It's not super formal, but it’s here because I need one to use some APIs. Let’s keep it simple.

## 2. What Information I Collect
I don’t really collect much info. But if you give me any (like an email or something), I’ll do my best not to lose it.

## 3. How I Use Your Information
If I do end up with your info, I’m only using it to make sure this thing works. No funny business.

## 4. Sharing Your Information
I’m not into selling or sharing your info with anyone. The only time I might share is if someone with legal power makes me.

## 5. Cookies and Tracking
I might use cookies, but they’re mainly to make things work better. Nothing creepy or weird. If you’re not into cookies, you can probably turn them off in your browser.

## 6. Your Choices
If you want to know what info I have on you, or you want it deleted, just ask. I’ll try to help out as best as I can.

## 7. Security
I’ll try to keep your info safe, but hey, nothing’s perfect. Don’t blame me if something goes wrong—I’m doing my best.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
If I change how I handle privacy, I’ll update this policy. Keep using this service? That means you’re cool with the changes.

## 9. Contact Information
Got questions or concerns? Just shoot me an email at privacy@benbowles.me, and I’ll get back to you when I can.
